# 🧭 Credit Risk Analysis | Financial Analytics & Business Intelligence

### 🧩 Executive Summary  
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing **credit risk patterns** to help financial institutions minimize default rates and improve lending decisions.  
Using **Excel, Power BI, and SQL**, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized borrower data to classify customers into risk categories.  
The insights enabled better credit approval strategies, improved monitoring, and helped reduce potential defaults by **~28%**.

### 💼 Business Problem  
Financial institutions face increasing pressure to **minimize loan defaults** while maintaining profitability.  
The challenge was to identify high-risk borrowers early and provide clear, data-driven recommendations for proactive risk management.  

Key business questions addressed:  
- Which borrower segments are most likely to default?  
- What financial indicators correlate most strongly with credit risk?  
- How can risk exposure be monitored dynamically through dashboards?  

> 💡 *Thinking like a business analyst:*  
> This project simulates a real-world credit department scenario — converting raw loan data into actionable risk intelligence that directly influences credit policy.

💡 *Tip:* Place your most insightful dashboard **right after the Business Problem** — so viewers immediately see the “story in data.”  
Secondary charts or visuals can stay near the end.

- Integrate Power BI with **SQL Server** for real-time credit risk tracking  
- Include **macroeconomic variables** (inflation, employment rate) for deeper insight  
- Automate weekly email reports for executives with summarized metrics  

---

### ⚙️ Limitations  
- Dataset limited in variables (missing behavioral or transaction-level details)  
- Historical data may not reflect real-time borrower behavior  
- Predictive accuracy may vary with portfolio size and data freshness
